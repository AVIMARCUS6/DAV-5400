        "## Introduction:\n",
        "New York City has a rat problem, and some believe it has gotten out of hand. Between 2010 and 2019 there have been over 130,000 rat sightings in New York City (https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2019/05/25/a-new-york-city-rat-invasion-130000-reported-rat-sightings-since-2010/#3fa6d51934d6). Rodents have taken over the city and the results are worrying. It was reported by Winnie Hu in her New York Times article, that the tables have turned (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/nyregion/rat-infestation-nyc.html). The infestation has gotten to the point where humans tend to find themselves dodging and avoiding the rodents as opposed to the scurrying away at the sound of footsteps."

        "In order to answer the research questions above we will use the data to create a thorough analysis of rat sightings in New York City. The \"nyc rat sightings\" (https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-rat-sightings/download) data will be used to to locate areas with higher number of reports. The data will be analyzed using summary statistics and bar plots. In order to properly classify locations the \"nyc buildings\",\"nyc property sales\" and \"crime new york city\" data will be used to identify if an area is part of a residential or commercial neighborhood based on buildings data. The property sales can be used to identify more expensive or cheaper neighborhoods. I will constrcut geo plots which overlay a map of rat sightings on differet breakups of the city, such as zip code, borough, street, and Sanitation District. The crime data will also help identify how the residents of a community treat their surroudnings. \"Beyond Broken Windows\" by Stephen Lurie, studies these communities and conlcudes that there is a correlation between crime and low quality of life (https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/02/broken-windows-theory-policing-urban-violence-crime-data/583030/). This data will then be analyzed to see if there is a relationship between crime rates and rat sightings based on area."
