    "## Introduction:\n",
    "New York City has a rat problem, and some believe it has gotten out of hand. Between 2010 and 2019 there have been over 130,000 rat sightings in New York City (https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2019/05/25/a-new-york-city-rat-invasion-130000-reported-rat-sightings-since-2010/#3fa6d51934d6). Rodents have taken over the city and the results are worrying. It was reported by Winnie Hu in her New York Times article, that the tables have turned (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/nyregion/rat-infestation-nyc.html). The infestation has gotten to the point where humans tend to find themselves dodging and avoiding the rodents as opposed to the scurrying away at the sound of footsteps."

    "## Research Questions:\n",
    "This project will analyze public data to get a better understanding of the rat problem. The goal will be to dig down to the core and discover possible causes for this infestation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What affect does weather have on the number of sightings?\n",
    "    - Do rats tend to come into the public in certain weather?\n",
    "- Where are the rat sightings most common?\n",
    "    - Which area of New York City are the rats sightings the highest."

This data will serve as the main dataset for this project and will be joined with other necessary datasets for analysis. The data will be analyzed using summary statistics and bar plots. It will then be used in conunction with other data sets and analyzed based off the new information for further insights.\n",

    "In order to answer the research questions above we will use the data to create a thorough analysis of rat sightings in New York City. The \"nyc rat sightings\" (https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-rat-sightings/download) data will be used to to locate areas with higher number of reports. The data will be analyzed using summary statistics and bar plots. I will constrcut geo plots which overlay a map of rat sightings on differet breakups of the city, such as zip code, borough, street. The crime data will also help identify how the residents of a community treat their surroudnings. This data will then be analyzed to see if there is a relationship between weather/temperature and number of rat sightings."
